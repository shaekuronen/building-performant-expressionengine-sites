<h2>CE Cache</h2>

<p>CE Cache allows you to store and retrieve parts of your templates (fragment caching) so they don’t have to be run each time the page is loaded. Since much of the heavy lifting doesn’t have to be run on each page-load, your performance increases can be astonishing.</p>

<p>CE Cache also supports full-page (static) caching. The static driver, which caches entire pages, uses a combination of file-based caching and .htaccess magic to serve your pages. This allows the cached files to completely circumvent ExpressionEngine®, and to render very quickly.</p>
